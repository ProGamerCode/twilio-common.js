Install
-------

### From NPM & Bower

It is not recommended to install this package directly since Twilio SDKs will
specify it themselves; however, if you so choose, you can install it from
[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twilio-common) with

```
npm install twilio-common
```

or install using [bower](http://bower.io) with

```
bower install twilio-common
```

### From Source

Clone the repo, install, and run [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/):

```
git clone https://code.hq.twilio.com/client/twilio-common.js
npm install
gulp
```
